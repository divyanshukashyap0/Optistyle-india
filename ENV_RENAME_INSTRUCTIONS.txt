ENVIRONMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

To run the project locally, follow these steps exactly:

1. LOCATE FILES
   - `env.txt` (Found in project root)
   - `backend/env.txt` (Found in backend folder)

2. RENAME (Frontend & Local Dev)
   - Rename `env.txt` → `.env`
   - Ensure it stays in the ROOT directory.

3. CONFIGURE
   - Open `.env`.
   - Replace all `CHANGE_ME` placeholders with your real API keys.
   - Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set to `http://localhost:5000/api`.

4. RESTART
   - If your terminal was open, restart it.
   - Run `npm run server` and `npm run dev` again.

5. BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (Optional)
   - Use `backend/env.txt` as a reference for setting variables on your cloud host (Render/Railway).
